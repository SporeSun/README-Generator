  ## Description

  I was motivated to simplify my development process by making my readme writing automated into an application. I built it because I'm lazy beyond belief and love to simplify my process. It solves the problem of copying and pasting things into a readme template and just following prompts. I learned how to effectively piecewise inquirer prompts into functions
